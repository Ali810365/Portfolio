                <h2>About Me | </h2>
                <p>Hi, my name is Ali Mohamed Abdi. I am studying app development at Seattle Central College.

                After completing my diploma, I went straight to college, and while in college, I got a job in
                    Management. 

                My work experience has disciplined me to take my responsibilities very seriously.

                I am currently a student in the Year Up program working towards acquiring my certifications in
                    software and web development.

                I consider myself to be a leader while also having a great experience in managing. I am wired to be
                    competitive and passionate in achieving the most out of everyone in whatever task I am given. </p>

                <h2>The Journey | </h2>
                <p>
                    My love for computers travels as far as I can remember. When most people make that statement, their love references the excitement
                    that runs through us when we use these machines. Of course I felt the same way but my adoration went furthure then that. I was 
                    astonished by how such a thing works and the magical secret. Eventually I came across programming in the 7th and thats when I knew
                    I wanted to be a programmer when I grow up. I studied many programming languages such as C++, C#, PHP, and Phyton.  
                    However at the time I didn't consider it as a career because for me it was a passion and a hobby. It wasn't until I got to college
                    when I decided I wanted to be a web developer and that's when I learned HTML and CSS along with Javascript. Since then I have dedicted
                    much of my time to being proficient at HTML, CSS and Javascript.
